 8 Week SQL Challenge – Case Study 1 (Danny's Diner)

 Project Description
This repository contains my solutions for Case Study 1 – Danny's Diner from the 8 Week SQL Challenge.  
The goal is to practice SQL querying, data analysis, and problem-solving using a sample restaurant dataset.

 Tools & Technologies
- Database: Oracle SQL  
- SQL Client: SQL Developer  
- Dataset Source: [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)

 Project Structure
/data → SQL scripts to create tables & insert sample data
/queries → SQL solution queries for each question
/results → Screenshots of query outputs (optional)
README.md → Project documentation


 How to Run
1. Open SQL Developer  
2. Create a new database connection  
3. Execute scripts in `/data` to create tables and insert data  
4. Run queries from the `/queries` folder  
5. Review results in `/results` (screenshots optional)

 Learning Objectives
- Practice SELECT queries and basic SQL  
- Use JOINs to combine multiple tables  
- Perform aggregations and GROUP BY operations  
- Apply window functions (e.g., `LAG`)  
- Analyze real-world datasets and extract insights

 Results
All case study questions were successfully solved. Skills improved include:  
- SQL querying and problem-solving  
- Understanding data trends  
- Generating clear outputs and visualizations
